PART ONE: Categorization

1. Kubernetes Core Resource Configuration

The fields that directly interact with or configure core Kubernetes resources. These fields are integral to the operation of Kubernetes pods, deployments, stateful sets, persistent volume claims (PVCs), and services. 

Examples:
metadata: Defines metadata of the CRD instance.
spec.volumeSpec: Configurations for persistent storage claims.
spec.affinity: Scheduling preferences to determine how pods are placed relative to other pods.
spec.secretsName, spec.sslSecretName: Reference to Kubernetes secrets for storing sensitive information.

2. Application-Specific Configuration

The fields specific to the configuration, operation, and management of the Percona Server for MySQL application. 

Examples:
spec.mysql: Configuration specific to MySQL, such as image, size, and cluster type.
spec.proxy.haproxy: HAProxy configuration for load balancing MySQL connections.
spec.backup: Backup configuration, including scheduling and storage options.
spec.pmm: Percona Monitoring and Management client configuration for application monitoring.

3. External Custom Resource Configuration

The fields that configure resources or services external to the Kubernetes cluster but are necessary for the application's functionality. 

Examples:
spec.backup.storages.s3: Configuration for Amazon S3 as an external storage service for backups.
spec.pmm.serverHost, spec.pmm.serverUser: Configuration for connecting to an external PMM server for monitoring.

PART TWO: Complexity Metric and Measurement

1. Complexity Metric
Configuration Depth (CD): The number of nested configuration levels which reflects the complexity of individual configurations.

Configuration Diversity (CvD): The variety of different configurations present within the CRD, considering Kubernetes core, application-specific, and external configurations. 

Dependency Complexity (DC): The number of external dependencies required for the CRD to function, such as external services (S3, monitoring services).

2. Complexity Measurement
Total Complexity Score(TCS) will be applied. It is computed by the following formula:
CCS = ( CD × CvD ) + DC

TCS provides a quantitative measure of the CRD's complexity, reflecting its configuration depth, diversity, and external dependencies.
