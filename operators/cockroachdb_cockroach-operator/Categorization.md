# CockroachDB Operator CRD Property Categorization

In the context of configuring and managing a CockroachDB cluster with Kubernetes, the CockroachDB operator CRD provides a wide range of properties. These properties can be categorized based on their functionality and impact on the cluster's operation. Below is a detailed categorization of these properties:

## Cluster Configuration
Properties that directly influence the setup and basic configuration of the CockroachDB cluster.

- **cockroachDBVersion**: Sets the specific version of the CockroachDB image.
- **nodes**: Specifies the number of nodes (pods) in the cluster.
- **dataStore**: Configures the database disk storage.

## Security and Authentication
Properties related to securing the cluster and authentication mechanisms.

- **clientTLSSecret**: Secret containing a certificate and a private key for the root database user.
- **nodeTLSSecret**: Secret with certificates and a private key for the TLS endpoint on the database port.
- **tlsEnabled**: Determines if TLS is enabled for the CockroachDB Cluster.

## Networking
Properties managing communication aspects, including ports and ingress configurations.

- **grpcPort**: Database port for gRPC communication.
- **httpPort**: Web UI port.
- **ingress**: Ingress configuration for service exposure.
- **sqlPort**: SQL Port number.

## Resource Management
Properties defining the computational resources allocated to the CockroachDB cluster and its components.

- **resources**: Resource limits for database containers.
- **cache**: Total size allocated for caches.
- **maxSQLMemory**: Maximum in-memory storage for SQL queries.

## Operational Behavior
Properties influencing the operational behavior and Kubernetes environment interactions.

- **affinity**: Scheduling constraints for pods.
- **automountServiceAccountToken**: Automounts the service account token in pods.
- **maxUnavailable**: Maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during updates.
- **minAvailable**: Minimum number of pods that must remain available during updates.
- **nodeSelector**: NodeSelector for pod scheduling.
- **tolerations**: Tolerations for scheduling on dedicated nodes.
- **topologySpreadConstraints**: Topology spread constraints for pods.

## Customization and Extensions
Properties allowing additional cluster customization and extensions.

- **additionalAnnotations**: Custom annotations added to all resources.
- **additionalArgs**: Extra command-line arguments for the `cockroach` binary.
- **additionalLabels**: Custom labels added to all resources.
- **image**: Container image information.
- **logConfigMap**: Config map for log configuration.
- **podEnvVariables**: Environment variables added to pods.

This categorization provides a structured overview of the CockroachDB operator CRD properties, facilitating a clearer understanding for users configuring and managing their CockroachDB clusters within Kubernetes.
