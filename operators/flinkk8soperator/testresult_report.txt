name: Alarm Insepction Report
about: An analysis report for the alarms produced by Acto

What happened
Why did Acto raise this alarm? What happened in the state transition? Why Acto’s oracles raised an alarm?

Root Cause
Why did the operator behave in this way? Please find the exact block in the operator source code resulting in the behavior.

Expected behavior?
If it is a true alarm, how to fix it in the operator code? If it is a false alarm, how to fix it in Acto code?

###
Before anything
###
When setting up the operator, I didn't add the Ingress resource to the application configuration. The associated source code is in deploy/config.yaml:
    operator:
      ingressUrlFormat: "{{$jobCluster}}.{ingress_suffix}"

According to the guidance, no ingress setup should be suitable for testing and debuging usage, as it is not a must for the cluster to communicate with the external world when running.
I realized that some alarms about the job Manager and task Manager components may be caused by this. Without an Ingress, it seems that the operator is not able to scale up or create the job Manager and task Manager components. This happens in each test run, which may lead to Acto not being able to detect changes made to their configs.
This will not be messioned every time an alarm is assessed.

### Alarm-280
/testrun-8workers-3-6-14-28/trial-00-0002/generation-003-runtime.json
Type: Alarm True

### What happened
Acto tried to change the spec.jobManagerConfig.affinity.podAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution.0.labelSelector.matchExpressions.0.key from ACTOKEY to NotPresent but failed.

### Root cause
There rised a consistency error that Acto does not find matching fields for this input change.
The discrepency is caused by the removal of these subfields when testing the operator's ability to reconcile when changing fields under the requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExectuion space. It seems that the crd is not capable of changing a modified or initialized field.
In flinkk8soperator/pkg/apis/app/v1beta1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go#L340, any changes to jobManagerConfig.Affinity should be kept when the DeepCopyInto is called.
I cannot find may further source code about jobManagerConfig.Affinity.

### Expected behavior
The operator should have found the field and make the correct modification instead of removing it, and Acto should have found the records.

### Alarm-285
/testrun-8workers-3-6-14-28/trial-00-0003/generation-004-runtime.json
Type: Alarm True, but may be a False Alarm or acto bug

### What happened
Acto tried to change the spec.jobManagerConfig.affinity.podAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution.0.topologykey from "" to ACTOKEY but failed.

### Root cause
There raised a consistency error that Acto does not find matching fields for this input change. But there actually exist the field in the system state at that time. It seems that Acto falsely behaviored or attributed an alarm.
The mutated-004.yaml records that the change was successful, but the change is not completed in the system-state-004.json. There is an inconsistency in Acto?

### Expected behavior
Acto should have found the records.

### Alarm-290
/testrun-8workers-3-6-14-28/trial-00-0004/generation-004-runtime.json
Type: Alarm True, but may be a False Alarm or acto bug

### What happened
Acto tried to change the spec.taskManagerConfig.affinity.podAntiAffinity.perferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution.0.podAddinityTerm.topologyKey from "" to ACTOKEY but failed.

### Root cause
There raised a consistency error that Acto does not find matching fields for this input change. But there actually exist the field in the system state at that time. It seems that Acto falsely behaviored or attributed an alarm.
The mutated-004.yaml and system-state-004.json all records that the field is successfully changed.

### Expected behavior
Acto should have found the records.

### Alarm-302
/testrun-8workers-3-6-14-28/trial-00-0006/generation-007-runtime.json
Type: Alarm True

### What happened
Acto tried to change the spec.taskManagerConfig.tolerations.0.effect from ACTOKEY to NotPresent but failed.

### Root cause
There raised a consistency error that Acto does not find matching fields for this input change.
The discrepency is caused by the removal of these subfields when testing the operator's ability to reconcile when changing fields under the taskManagerConfig.tolerations space. It seems that the crd is not capable of changing a modified or initialized field.
In flinkk8soperator/pkg/apis/app/v1beta1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go#L412, any changes to taskManagerConfig.Affinity should be kept when the DeepCopyInto is called.

### Expected behavior
The operator should have found the field and make the correct modification instead of removing it, and Acto should have found the records.

### Alarm-306

### Alarm-311
/testrun-8workers-3-6-14-28/trial-00-0008/generation-004-runtime.json
Type: Alarm True, but may be a False Alarm or acto bug

### What happened
Acto tried to change the spec.savepointInfo.savepointLocation from "" to ACTOKEY but failed.

### Root cause
There raised a consistency error that Acto does not find matching fields for this input change. But there actually exist the field in the system state at that time. It seems that Acto falsely behaviored or attributed an alarm.
The mutated-004.yaml and system-state-004.json all records that the field is successfully changed. There is an inconsistency in Acto?
Meanwhile, concurrent to the 004 phase, the tolerations for taskManagerConfig is also removed. There may be some relationships between the two.
But I cannot find any more source code associated with these fields. I searched the whole flinkk8soperator directory and examined the four files found to contain the word "tolerations", which are types.go, zz_generated.deepcopy.go, job_manager_controller.go, and test_manager_controller.go, but there are no specific functions or settings I can find related to this phenomenon. Maybe it is because that the developers didn't define such behaviors that such failures exist.

### Expected behavior
Acto should have found the records.

### Alarm-352
/testrun-8workers-3-6-14-28/trial-01-0000/generation-004-runtime.json
Type: Alarm True, but may be a False Alarm or acto bug

### What happened

The mutated-004.yaml and system-state-004.json all records that the field is successfully changed. There is an inconsistency in Acto?
In flinkk8soperator/pkg/container/flink/container_utils.go#L64, when the application's restartnonce is not "", its application annotation will be updated. This should be a very simple updating machenism, but it may have not left any records or interactions with K8S.

### Expected behavior
Acto should have found the records.

### Alarm-367
/testrun-8workers-3-6-14-28/trial-01-0002/generation-004-runtime.json
Type: Alarm True

### What happened
Acto tried to change the spec.taskManagerConfig.affinity.podAntiAffinity.perferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution.0.podAffinityTerm.labelSelector.matchLabels from ACTOKEY to NotPresent but failed.

### Root cause
There raised a consistency error that Acto does not find matching fields for this input change.
The discrepency is caused by the removal of these subfields when testing the operator's ability to reconcile when changing fields under the taskManagerConfig.affinity space. It seems that the crd is not capable of changing a modified or initialized field. It deleted the whole preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution space instead.
There are no obvious code pieces related to this field. The taskManagerConfig is updated by deep copy in zz_generated.deepcopy.go, which may be a cause why there are no record of reconcilation. It just accepts every change.

### Expected behavior
The operator should have found the field and make the correct modification instead of removing it, and Acto should have found the records.

### Alarm-376

### Expected behavior
Acto should have found the records.

### Alarm-397
/testrun-8workers-3-6-14-28/trial-01-0008/generation-001-runtime.json
Type: Alarm True, detected to be a Misoperation

### What happened
The deployment should have 1 replica, but only 0 are available.

### Root cause
According to events-001.json#L1813 and 1880, when trying to scaling up the job manager for the deployment, because Ingress does not have a matching part in k8s v1beta1 or Ingress is not explicitely defined.
According to the user guide of the operator, the absense of the Ingress should not interfere the normal operation of the operator, or it is permitted to not define an Ingress. I thus didn't define it.
Maybe in later runs I can define an Ingress and retry acto testruns.

### Expected behavior
The operator should have successfully scaled up to 1, which is merely creating an instance.

There raised a consistency error that Acto does not find matching fields for this input change.
The discrepency is caused by the removal of these subfields when testing the operator's ability to reconcile when changing fields under the taskManagerConfig.affinity space. It seems that the crd is not capable of changing a modified or initialized field. It deleted the whole preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution space instead.

There is an open question on how to improve the usability of Acto by grouping the duplicated alarms. Can you think of some features which can be used to determine if two alarms are duplicated?

When examining alarms, I find sometimes two alarms are duplicated. An common situation is that acto is trying to execute two different operations on the same field.
The two operations may be of different moves, e.g., changing from "" to ACTOKEY and from ACTOKEY to NotPresent, but they are on the same field.
If may be possible to check if such modifications are necessary.
